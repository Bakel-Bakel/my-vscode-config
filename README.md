There is a mismatch between the expected theme filename and what's actually defined in the extension (I mailed the extension owners with no reply yet, the repo isn¬¥t public so I could not sneak in a PR, but a local fix will do!).

Go to terminal

```sh
cd ~/.vscode/extensions/

code .

```
Then navigate to the package.json file

![alt text](docs/error-dir1.png)

Change line 43 that specifies path from 

```sh
./themes/Community-Material-Theme-Default-High-Contrast.json"
```
to 
```sh
./themes/aries-Darker-High-Contrast.json
```

After this, you will have to close all instances of your vscode and then boot again. If you try to apply the theme, it might fail first and then vscode will ask you to reload extensions from disk as changes has been made.
